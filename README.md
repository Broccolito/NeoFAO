The foot and ankle offset (FAO) is widely used as three-dimensional biometrics generated from weightbearing computed tomography (WBCT) images to classify and quantify foot and ankle deformities (Lintz et al. 2017). Although FAO demonstrated reduced bias on deformity classification compared to previous methods utilizing two-dimensional radiographs, its accuracy and sensitivity are yet to be manifested among clinical cases with severe deformities.

In this study, we used clinical cases and mathematical induction to showcase limitations of FAO, particularly among severe deformity cases where the metatarsal-calcaneus triangle is unparalleled from the ground. To revise the current FAO algorithm, we moved the projection of the center of talus from the ground to the metatarsal-calcaneus triangle and propose the neo- foot and ankle offset (NeoFAO). Despite increased accuracy and sensitivity of NeoFAO, its shortcomings are acknowledged due to complex anatomical structure of foot and ankle. Inventing new three-dimensional biometrics that consider more detailed anatomical structure from WBCT is therefore essential.
